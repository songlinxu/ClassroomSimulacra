Spiking neural networks: They consider the spike timings rather than just the spiking frequency, which is an important feature of biological neural networls. A biological neuron integrates the inputs and decides whether it generates a spike or not. Three images showing that.

Training an RNN by using backpropagation is more complicated than training an ANN with no loops. Unfolding: The loops are removed by duplicating parts of the neural network whenever they represent different parts of the sentence. After unfolding, we can train the RNN the way we train ANNs without loops. A picture illustrating the concept of unfolding.

Pooling condense the output of small regions of neurons into a single output. This helps simplify the following layers and reduces the number of parameters that the model needs to learn. Max pooling: take the largest number (maximum) in the region. Average pooling: take the average of the numbers in the region. A picture showing max pooling and average pooling.

Unfolding: The loops are removed by duplicating parts of the neural network whenever they represent different parts of the sentence. After unfolding, we can train the RNN the way we train ANNs without loops. A picture illustrating the concept of unfolding.

What are they? <please input your answer>	The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model. The short-term memory in the LSTM can be kept unchanged as several inputs are processed. Short-Term Memory of LSTM: can be kept or rewritten, depending on the current short-term memory, input, and connection weights. LSTM can control how long it holds the current memory. A picture illustrating how short term memory is manipulated in LSTM.

The network is called a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) because it has a loop in the connection to feed the previous activations back to the input. This network receives one word at a time and is trained to generate an output each time using supervised learning with additional 'desired outputs'. Another usage: They can also be trained to represent phrases and sentences. A picture of RNN.

Training an RNN by using backpropagation is more complicated than training an ANN with no loops. Unfolding: The loops are removed by duplicating parts of the neural network whenever they represent different parts of the sentence. After unfolding, we can train the RNN the way we train ANNs without loops. A picture illustrating the concept of unfolding.

Humans are thought to have two kinds of memory: Short-Term Memory and Long-Term Memory. E.g. 'Memorizing a phone number to make a phone call' uses your Short-Term Memory. 'Memorizing your friend's name' uses your Long-Term Memory. A picture showing repitition of short-term memory could convert to long-term memory.
